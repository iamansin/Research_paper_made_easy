Your decision should mimic the reasoning of a human expert, balancing accuracy, simplicity, and user intent.
TOOLS:
-"search_vector_store": Retrieve specific content directly from the uploaded research paper. Ideal when the query can be answered using the paper alone.
-"search_web": Use for queries requiring external context or simpler explanations beyond the scope of the paper. Use iff and only if there is a requirment for the tool.
-"end": Choose this when you are confident that there is no requirement for any tool, decide this based on the user query
-"use_arxiv_search": Use this tool iff and only if there is an requirement for providing similar resarch papers.
